## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version recommended)
- npm or Yarn
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository (or Start Fresh)**

If you already have the project files:
```bash
cd path/to/your/project
````

If starting from scratch:

```bash
npx create-react-app securesight-dashboard
cd securesight-dashboard
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

Install base dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Install Tailwind CSS and peer dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

3. **Configure Tailwind CSS**

In `tailwind.config.js`, update the content paths:

```js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        inter: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

In `src/index.css`, add:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

4. **Add Google Fonts**

In `public/index.html`, inside the `<head>`:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@300;400;500;600;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

5. **Add Application Code**

Replace the contents of `src/App.js` with the React code provided in the assessment.

6. **Start the Development Server**

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

The application will run at:
üëâ `http://localhost:3000`

## üí° Simulated Backend

For the assessment, the backend is simulated using an in-memory JavaScript array and mock `api` functions. These simulate CRUD operations and emulate network latency.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

* Real-time-like incident updates (simulated)
* Responsive layout with Tailwind CSS
* Icon-driven interface with Lucide
* Incident list with resolve functionality
* Modular, reusable components

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

### Backend Integration

* Replace in-memory data with a real backend (Node.js, Flask, etc.)
* Use a persistent database (PostgreSQL, SQLite)
* Implement RESTful APIs for incidents

### Real-time Functionality

* Replace polling with WebSockets (e.g., Socket.IO)

### Incident Player Enhancements

* Integrate live video (HLS, MPEG-DASH)
* Add video controls and timeline scrubbing

### Timeline Enhancements

* Drag-and-drop scrubber
* Incident markers with details
* Zoom and filter functionality

### Authentication

* Add JWT-based auth
* Role-based access control (RBAC)

### Incident Management

* Filter, search, sort incidents
* Notes, tags, "false alarm" or "escalate" actions

### Notifications

* Browser and in-app notifications for critical incidents

### UI/UX Improvements

* Toast notifications for actions
* Detailed error handling

### Accessibility (A11y)

* Keyboard navigation
* ARIA attributes
* Improved color contrast

### Testing

* Unit testing with Jest + React Testing Library
* Integration tests for simulated API
